*What I learned on the journey chasing a tricky memory leak in HEY.*

---

In this article, I tell the story of a memory leak we had in our [HEY app](https://www.hey.com/), the cool tools I could use to investigate and how I finally figured out the root cause.
Memory leaks can be tricky to diagnose and having the right set of tools makes a huge difference.
I hope my adventures help you the next time you’re in a similar situation.

## The beginning

Everything started with a report from our Operations team mentioning that HEY memory usage was often getting close to boiling over. We rarely deploy HEY during the weekends, and that’s when the issue manifested itself the most:

The leak

After a few days without deploying the app, the memory usage almost reached 100%, and then a deployment would reset it back to normal.
This signals a slow and steady memory leak.

## Checking Ruby heap allocations

The first approach I tried was logging and analyzing the Ruby Heap allocation stats. In particular, I looked for endpoints where:
- A minor (or major) GC run happened.
- `heap_available_slots` increased greatly.

The theory is that when GC runs, it should clear most of the newly allocated objects, hence an increase of `heap_available_slots` paired with a GC run shouldn’t happen unless there is a leak.

The analysis exposed 2 endpoints:
- `MessagesController#update`
- `TopicsController#show`

These are the most heavily used endpoints of the app, so the result wasn’t conclusive at all.

---

## Heap dump

I decided to proceed by extracting a Ruby heap dump. Luckily this can be done by running [rbtrace](https://github.com/tmm1/rbtrace) in the app servers:

```
bundle exec rbtrace -p $worker_pid -e 'Thread.new{GC.start; require "objspace"; File.open("/tmp/0.json","w"){|f| ObjectSpace.dump_all(output: f) }}'
```

This command writes the `$worker_pid` heap dump to `/tmp/0.json`.

Unfortunately, a heap dump extracted without enabling object trace allocation doesn’t contain key information such as:
- The GC generation it was allocated in
- The filename and line number it was allocated in
- A truncated value
- Object bytesize

So even the basic heap dump wasn’t enough to find the culprit.

### ObjectSpace.trace_object_allocations_start

Enabling object trace allocation [greatly slows down the response times and increases memory usage](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-trunk/libdoc/objspace/rdoc/ObjectSpace.html#method-c-trace_object_allocations_start) but I had no more options left, so I still decided to proceed.
To mitigate this performance degradation, I enabled object trace allocation **only on one app host** and only for the time needed to extract the heap dumps I needed.
I also monitored the host during the process: If something went wrong, I could’ve immediately stopped the host traffic from the load balancer to mitigate it.

I managed to extract 3 heap dumps without any issues:
- 0.json: ~15min after deploy
- 1.json: ~40min after deploy
- 2.json: ~1h after the deploy

It was time to analyze them!

### Analysis

The first analysis was via [heapy diff](https://github.com/zombocom/heapy?tab=readme-ov-file#diff-2-heap-dumps):

```
jacopo-37s-mb 3.3.0-preview2 ~/Desktop/Hey heap dumps/1-tracing heapy diff 0.json 1.json 2.json |head -n 10
Retained STRING 18947 objects of size 1290614/16768824 (in bytes) at: /usr/local/bundle/ruby/3.3.0/bundler/gems/okra-d3937f2a023c/lib/okra/html.rb:19

Retained STRING 3634 objects of size 247720/16768824 (in bytes) at: /usr/local/bundle/ruby/3.3.0/gems/prometheus-client-mmap-1.0.0/lib/prometheus/client/histogram.rb:21
Retained STRING 2895 objects of size 939094/16768824 (in bytes) at: /usr/local/bundle/ruby/3.3.0/gems/json-2.6.3/lib/json/common.rb:312
```

Which outlined `lib/okra/html.rb:19`, and I thought this was the root cause; but after digging further, I wasn’t able to find any leaking code related.
Luckily, the heap dumps extracted with object trace allocation enabled contained the object dependency tree, so I decided to take a look at it and figure out what was retaining `lib/okra/html.rb:19`; and for that, I used [sheap](https://github.com/jhawthorn/sheap).

Initially, I extracted from the heap dump a few addresses associated with `lib/okra/html.rb:19`:

```
jacopo-37s-mb 3.3.0 ~/Desktop/Hey heap dumps/1-tracing grep "file.*lib/okra/html.rb.*line.*19" 2.json | head |  grep -o "address\":\"[^\"]\+\""
address":"0x7fbfec2c0098"
address":"0x7fbfec2c0110"
address":"0x7fbfec2c0138"
address":"0x7fbfec2c0408"
address":"0x7fbfec2c0430"
address":"0x7fbfec2c0480"
address":"0x7fbfec2c04d0"
address":"0x7fbfec2c04f8"
address":"0x7fbfec2c0908"
address":"0x7fbfec2c0980"
```

Then, I checked their dependency tree with sheap, and found a common pattern:

```
jacopo-37s-mb 3.3.0 ~/Desktop/Hey heap dumps/1-tracing sheap 0.json 2.json
irb#1():004> $diff.after.find_path($diff.after.at("0x7fbfec2c0098"))

```

All these objects were retained by YJIT, this is clearly shown by the `yjit_root` node in the top of the dependency tree!
After finding the root cause I opened an [issue](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby/issues/552) for the YJIT team, which [promptly fixed it](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/9693).

## Conclusion

The current tooling in Ruby to troubleshoot memory leaks is pretty advanced. Generally, an effective approach is to use `rbtrace`, to extract a heap dump (with object trace allocation enabled); and then analyze it via [heapy](https://github.com/zombocom/heapy), [sheap](https://github.com/jhawthorn/sheap), or any other similar tool.

Happy hunting!
